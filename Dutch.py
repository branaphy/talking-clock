# This code contains logic related to the linguistic rules of telling time in Dutch.

In Dutch, the use of 'half past' is a bit different compared to English and Italian. The use of *half* is actually the next hour minus half an hour, 
for example half past 1 is in Dutch *half 2*.
'A quarter to' and 'a quarter past' are used the same compared to English, a quarter past 1, is 'kwart over 1'. 
Another thing that is remarkable is the use of 5 and 10 minutes after an half hour. In Dutch it is normal to use a phrase like: *Het is 10 over half 4*. The literal translation 
in English would be: 'It is 10 past half past 3' (It is 20 to 4). This is also possible for 5 and 10 minutes before an half hour, for example: *Het is 5 voor half 2*, the literal
translation would be: 'It is 5 to half past 1' (It is 25 past 1). 
After a round number it is the same as in English: *Het is 5 over 3*, 'It is 5 past 3'.
