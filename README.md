## Linguistic Rules for Telling Time
### Dutch

### American English

### Italian
The Italian language has a telling time system similar to English, telling first the hours and then the minutes, and having expressions to indicate the half and the quarters of the hours. The former is expressed through the word “*mezzo*” or “*mezza*”, depending on the variety, while the former is translated to “*un quarto*”. Hours are usually indicated using simple numbers, except for 01:00 a.m./p.m. for which is not used the standard form of the cardinal number "*uno*", but the female form “*una*”. Additionally, we decided not to use the number to indicate 12:00 a.m./p.m., but the more spread expressions “*mezzogiorno*” (midday) and “*mezzanotte*” (midnight).

The 12-hour format is commonly used in Italy, but in formal contexts and some regional varieties, the 24-hour format is preferred.

Instead of using all the numbers to indicate the exact minute, we opted for a simplified approach to telling time by only indicating it every five minutes.
These choices reflect the most common way of telling time in Italian, despite using numbers being perfectly acceptable in the aforementioned cases. It is worth noting that these expressions are not pan-Italian, but rather based on the Tuscan variant of Italian.

### Mandarin Chinese
The logic of telling time in Chinese usually describes the current time by hour and minute. In Chinese, the following information is usually included:
The current hour: usually expressed in 12-hour format, such as “shang wu 9 dian”(9:00 am) or "xia wu 3 dian”(3:00 pm).
Current minutes: Minutes are usually expressed in Arabic numerals, followed by “fen”(minute), e.g. "9 dian 15 fen”(9:15) or "3 dian 45 fen”(3:45). When it’s on the hour, “zheng”(o’clock) will be added after the hour, e.g. “9 dian zheng”(9:00 o’clock).
Some additional information:  "xian zai shi"(the current time is) to introduce a description of the time. “Shang wu”(AM) and “xia wu”(PM): usually it is indicated whether it is morning or afternoon, to distinguish different times of the day.
