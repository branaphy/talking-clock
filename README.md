## Linguistic Rules for Telling Time
### Dutch

In Dutch, the use of 'half past' is a bit different compared to English and Italian. The use of "*half*" is actually the next hour minus half an hour, 
for example half past 1 is in Dutch "*half 2*".
'A quarter to' and 'a quarter past' are used the same compared to English, a quarter past 1, is "*kwart over 1*". 
Another thing that is remarkable is the use of 5 and 10 minutes after an half hour. In Dutch it is normal to use a phrase like: "*Het is 10 over half 4*". The literal translation in English would be: 'It is 10 past half past 3' (It is 20 to 4). This is also possible for 5 and 10 minutes before an half hour, for example: "*Het is 5 voor half 2*", the literal translation would be: 'It is 5 to half past 1' (It is 25 past 1). 
After a round hour, the sentences in English and Dutch are quite similar: "*Het is 5 over 3*", 'It is 5 past 3'. 
Instead of using the word 'o'clock', "*uur*" is used which means 'hour'. 
Differentiations between am and pm are mostly done by using "*'s ochtends*" (morning), "*'s middags*" (afternoon), "*'s avonds*" (evening) and "*'s nachts*" (night). 
The use of these is a bit arbitrary, some people think 4 am is morning and some people will say it is night. There is a bit of a grey area between 3 am and 5 am, there is not really a right or wrong here. The rest is quite strict, the morning is used until 12 pm, the afternoon is used until 6 pm, the evening is used until 12 am and the night is from 12 am. For example: 'It is 12 am' would be "*Het is 12 uur 's nachts.*". 
A small remark, the "*'s*" is short for "*des*", which was the second case (genetive) in Dutch. The second case is barely used anymore, but the "*'s*" is still used.

### American English

### Italian
The Italian language has a telling time system similar to English, usually telling first the hour and then the minutes, and having expressions to indicate the half and the quarters of the hours. The former is expressed through the word “*mezzo*” or “*mezza*”, depending on the variety, while the former is translated to “*un quarto*”. Hours are usually indicated using simple numbers, except for 01:00 a.m./p.m. for which is not used the standard form of the cardinal number "*uno*", but the female form “*una*”. Additionally, we decided not to use the number to indicate 12:00 a.m./p.m., but the more spread expressions “*mezzogiorno*” (midday) and “*mezzanotte*” (midnight).

The 12-hour format is commonly used in Italy, but in formal contexts and some regional varieties, the 24-hour format is preferred.

Instead of using all the numbers to indicate the exact minute, we opted for a simplified approach to telling time by only indicating it every five minutes. Hence, the clock will not tell the exact mminutes, but the closest multiple of five. For example, if the time is 4:08 p.m. it will say "*quattro e dieci*" (lit. en. "ten past four").
These choices reflect the most common way of telling time in Italian, despite using numbers being perfectly acceptable in the aforementioned cases. It is worth noting that these expressions are not pan-Italian, but rather based on the Tuscan variant of Italian.

### Mandarin Chinese
The logic of telling time in Chinese usually describes the current time by hour and minute. In Chinese, the following information is usually included:
The current hour: usually expressed in 12-hour format, such as “shang wu 9 dian”(9:00 am) or "xia wu 3 dian”(3:00 pm).
Current minutes: Minutes are usually expressed in Arabic numerals, followed by “fen”(minute), e.g. "9 dian 15 fen”(9:15) or "3 dian 45 fen”(3:45). When it’s on the hour, “zheng”(o’clock) will be added after the hour, e.g. “9 dian zheng”(9:00 o’clock).
Some additional information:  "xian zai shi"(the current time is) to introduce a description of the time. “Shang wu”(AM) and “xia wu”(PM): usually it is indicated whether it is morning or afternoon, to distinguish different times of the day.

### Latin and German
For both Latin and German we used the gTTS package and we opted for a very simple way of telling time: lit. "It is" + hour + "hour and" + minutes + "minutes". It translates directly in German to "Es ist" + hour + "Uhr" + minutes + "minuten", while for Latin the translation is slightly more complex since the syntactic structure of the Latin sentence is reversed. The resulting sentence will be "Hora est" + hour (expressed using cardinal numbers) + "et" + minutes (expressed using cardinal numbers) + "minuta". The literal translation would be: "The hour is ...th and ...th minutes".
