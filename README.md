## Linguistic Rules for Telling Time
### Dutch

### English

### Italian
The Italian language has a telling time system similar to English, telling first the hours and then the minutes, and having expressions to indicate the half and the quarters of the hours. The former is expressed through the word “mezzo” or “mezza”, depending on the variety, while the former is translated to “un quarto”. Hours are usually indicated using simple numbers, except for 01:00 a.m./p.m. for which is not used the standard form of the cardinal number, but the female form “una”. Additionally, we decided not to use 12 a.m./p.m., but the more spread expressions  “mezzogiorno” (midday) and “mezzanotte” (midnight).
The 12-hour format is commonly used in Italy, but in formal contexts and some regional varieties, the 24-hour format is preferred.
Instead of using all the numbers to indicate the exact minute, we opted for a simplified approach to telling time by only indicating it every five minutes.
These choices reflect the most common way of telling time in Italian, despite using numbers being perfectly acceptable in the aforementioned cases. It is worth noting that these expressions are not pan-Italian, but rather based on the Tuscan variant of Italian.
